cd respond-framework
yarn

cd examples/api-translator
yarn
yarn start
```


## What's Going On?

*API Translator* is being treated like an example app for the Respond Framework. 

**Why?** Optimum developer experience for making changes to *Respond* while working on *API Translator*. For examples, there's working hot module replacement for changes within both tiers.

Sometime in the future the app will leave the mothership, and we'll simply remove Respond code. It's no biggie.

> Respond is being customized to the needs of your app. **This is what you're paying for. This is how we soar!**
